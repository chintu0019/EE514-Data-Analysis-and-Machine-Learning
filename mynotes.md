## Introduction to Python

- basics
  - variables and types
  - type conversions
  - basic operations
    - ** for power (^) = x**2
  - containers
    - list
      - mutable - can be changed
      - indexed from 0
      - can contain objs of any type
      => x = []
      - last item in list x[-1]
      - slicing
        - first three items = x[0:3] 0r x[:3]
  - dict
    - like hashmaps or associative arrays
    - key -> value map
    => y = {'key' : value}
  - also has tuples and sets

    - to leave a block empty, use keyword "pass"
    - functions
      - can handle multiple arguments - variadic arguments (*args)
        - def func_name (*args)
    - **_TODO_**: OO aspects in python
    - constructors inside classes
      - special method
      - \__name__
      - will have to use the keyword "self" explicitly as the first argument to the methods in the class
    - module is the .py file - can import to different file
    - package
      - collection of modules
        - create folder with a name
        - add \__init__.py file
    - **_TODO_**: exceptions
    - always prefer to use try-except block
      - example when trying to check if the file exists, use try-except instead of if-else
    - list comprehensions
      - can avoid loops
    - **_TODO_**: generators
      - "yield" keyword
      - transfer control from inside a loop to the caller
    - standard and external libraries

    - Example - Wikipedia scraper

## Numerical programming with numpy

- optimized for numerical computation
- single data type per array
- **_TODO_**: numpy methods
- stride is the third index in the list - can be used to specify the depth
  - negative stride can be used for reversal
- matrix arithmetic operations
  - uses python operations
  - matrix multiplications - use @
  - '*' does element wise multiplications
- linear algebra -np.linalg
- **_TODO_**: eigen values, matrix, stacking, concatenation
- **NEXT CLASS**: Mathematics refresher for ML
